## This file contains examples of coding tricks that could be useful.

# # Tip #1 On any line, the characters after the "#" symbol are called "comments"
# # and will not effect the way the code you write runs.

# # Tip #2 By highlighting a set of lines and pressing command and "/" at the same time
# # will auto comment all the lines for you.

# # Tip #3 The command "print", followed by a value will print the value. The code below
# # calculates 1 + 1 which evaluates to 2, which it prints.

print(1 + 1)

# # Tip #4 Surrounding characters two quotation marks creates a value called a "string".
# # strings are values which are a sequence of characters.

print("1 + 1")

# # Tip #5 The method format can be use to specify where in a string other values should
# # be inserted. It is called in the format string.format(...)

print("This is an example to enter the result of 1 + 1 = {}.".format(1 + 1))
# Is the same as:
print("This is an example to enter the result of 1 + 1 = 2.")
# or:
print("This is an example to enter the result of 1 + 1 = " + str(1 + 1) + ".")

# # Tip #6 The methods upper and lower can be used to either capitalize or make lowercase
# # all characters in a string respectively.

print("toUpperCase".upper())
print("TOlOWWERcASE".lower())
